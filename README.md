Code Refactor

# HTML, CSS and Git Challenge

## Description

The Module one Challenge is a HTML, CSS and Git Challenge to refactor the code to improve accessibility standards for a marketing agency webpage. The CSS must be reworked to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties and HTML elements must follow a logical structure. 

## Notes

"Refactor" means to improve code without changing what it does, and is one of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
